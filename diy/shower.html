<section id="1"><h1>Overview</h1>
  <a href="https://t.ly/FJNj">This</a> is the manual for the existing Triton
  Jade (IPX4?) shower unit. It has a power rating of 8.7-9.5kW.
  <a href="https://t.ly/_ghz">Good ref</a>.

  <p>
    I like the Triton T80z fast fit range with its swivel fits meaning
    the electric cable and water entry points can come in from multiple directions.
    <a href="https://t.ly/-Fy09">Fitting instructions</a>.
    It is a <code>thermostatic shower</code>, meaning it keeps a steady temperature.
  </p>

  I could further increase the water pressure by using a low pressure shower head.
  It probably increases the pressure by allowing more air in?
  Electric showers may need their water tanks to be emptied quickly so
  perhaps an <code>eco shower head</code> may not be suitable with an electric shower.
  However some electric showers have eco modes. They tend to be more
  expensive though and I can't find a good enough video showing me the 
  difference. <a href="https://t.ly/sBfkl">This</a> has some starting info.

  <p>
    I think the difference between an eco-head and a low-pressure head is the former
    deliberately shoots out water at a low pressure but makes it feel as if it's 
    high pressure. Whereas the latter is used in cases where the pressure is already low.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Fuses and switches</h1>
  The fuse at the consumer unit is rated at 40A. The shower fuse has the
  markings: <code>B40, 5940s</code>.
  <a href="https://t.ly/fJzO">This</a> is a good example of such a switch.
  It has a <code>Breaking Capacity</code> rating of 6kA and a 
  <code>Rated Operational Current (ROC)</code> of 40A.

  <p>
    The boldly written power rating for triton showers is for 240V.
    An equivalent 8.5kW for 240V is 7.5kW for 230V.
    So, $I = \frac{7500}{230} = 32.6A$.
    I need at least $I = \frac{8500}{230} = 36.9A$.
    With a higher power rating, a high flow rate can be maintained whilst
    not compromising on the temperature. Also, look for thermostatic options.
    An equivalent 9.5kW for 240V is 8.7kW for 230V - 
    <a href="https://t.ly/FlfB">page 7</a>.
    <a href="https://t.ly/Lk_u">This</a> is the shower we need.
  </p>
</section>

<section><h1>Electric cable diameter</h1>
  6mm cable can carry up to 9kW.
  On <a href="https://t.ly/FlfB">page 10</a>, it says how to measure the diameter.
</section>

<section><h1>Entry points for water/electricity</h1>
  Triton allows multiple entry points.
</section>

<section><h1>Shower pressure</h1>
  One cannot have a water pump attached to the mains water supply. I'm guessing a lot of
  appliances/taps etc depend on the water pressure being standard like 1 bar and not any 
  higher. In areas where the water pressure is low, a pump would be required but I'm guessing
  this would have to be disconnected from the mains. For example, water stored in a tank
  is pumped to the required pressure which is then fed into the shower.
