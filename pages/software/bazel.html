<section id="1"><h1>Overview</h1>
  Good to use with a project that has multiple coding languages - 
  C++, Java, Python, Nodejs, Rust etc. Used with tensor flow. Google supports it.
  Download a binary release from <a href="https://t.ly/dn7z9">here</a> - bazelisk-linux-amd64.

  Follow <a href="https://bit.ly/3FOlrhA">these instructions</a> to install 
  bazel using apt. <a href="https://t.ly/04QTG">Good C++</a> tutorial.
  Checkout the concepts section as well.
  <a href="https://t.ly/f2W6t">Good video</a> on hello world for Bazel.
  I found <a href="https://t.ly/WVpd">this</a> very useful.

    <button class="accordion">Reddit user's view on Bazel vs cmake</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p></p>
        We have recently migrated multiple CMake projects to Bazel and am very happy 
        with the result.
        <p>
          Bazel is a better and more powerful build system overall, is more hermetic, 
          has stronger support for accurate caching and parallel execution, 
          including remote caching and remote execution, and caching and parallel/remote 
          execution of tests, doing code generation directly in the build (eg protobuf), 
          can produce docker images directly, and excels at integrating multiple 
          languages together into the same build and at integration testing. 
          And the build language is a straightforward limited version of Python. 
          You can include multiple different configurations and toolchains in the 
          same build as well.
        </p>
        
        Broadly I find Bazel does things "more correctly" even if it is harder to get 
        started with, and it works great with lots of languages as well.

        <p>
          CMake is a simpler, less featureful build system that is more broadly used with an 
          objectively worse configuration language, but more people know it, 
          it has easier access to libraries and works with more IDEs.
        </p>
        
        Personally I either found Bazel builds of all the libraries I needed or they were 
        trivial enough to include with http_archive and BUILD file containing a 
        simple cc_library target. There is also rules_foreign_cc that allows 
        you to delegate to the CMake build of an external library.

        <p>
          Both build systems are full of their own annoyances, but Bazel is more general, 
          more powerful, more forward looking and gets the fundamentals right.
          Another thing thatâ€™s nice about Bazel is with --disk_cache it will remember 
          all previous build and test results instead of just the most recent one, 
          so you can switch back and forth between branches without needing to rebuild and retest.
        </p>

<section id="2"><h1>C++</h1>
  The main aim is to build the C++ binary.
  <subsection id="2.0"><h1>Directory structure for a single file</h1>
    The constituent files of the root directory would be:
    <ul>
      <li>main.cc</li>
      In this case, it's our main and only c++ file.

      <p>
        <li>BUILD</li>
<pre><code class="c++">
cc_binary (
  name = "main",
  srcs = ["main.cc"],
)
</code></pre>   
        This is the rule for the build. The path name of the source file is 
        called the <code>target name</code>. The output of the 
        <code>cc_binary</code> rule gets stored in <code>bazel-bin</code>.      
      </p>

      <li>WORKSPACE</li>
      We tell Bazel where the root of the workspace is. We place this in
      the root folder.   
    </ul>

    Within the same directory, other directories get added on after a build
    (These are symbolic links):
    <ul>
      <li>bazel-bin</li>
      The output of the <code>cc_binary</code> rule gets stored in 
      <code>bazel-bin</code>.

      <p>
        <li>bazel-out</li>
      </p>

      <li>bazel-testlogs</li>
      Say we had a folder called 'mylib' (see the python example below). 
      To see the test log, check 
      <code>bazel-testlogs -> mylib -> test -> test.log</code> 
    </ul>
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="2.1"><h1>Directory for multiple files</h1>
    We'll have a library to be shared between multiple files.
    In the same directory, we'll now have:
    <br>
    BUILD, WORKSPACE, main.cc, mylib.cc, mylib.hh
    
    <p>
      main.cc needs to use a function from mylib.cc so includes
      mylib.hh. The build rule file is as follows:
<pre><code class="C++">
cc_binary (
  name = "main",
  srcs = ["main.cc"],
  deps = [":mylib"]
)

cc_library (
  name = "mylib",
  hdrs = ["mylib,hh"],
  srcs = ["mylib.cc"],
)
</code></pre>           
    </p>

  </subsection>
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Python</h1>
  <subsection id="3.0"><h1>Directory structure for a single file</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>main.py</li>

      <p>
        <li>BUILD</li>
<pre><code class="python">
py_binary (
  name = "main",
  srcs = ["main.py"],
)  
</code></pre>        
      </p>

      <li>WORKSPACE</li>
    </ul>    
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="3.1"><h1>Directory structure for a library</h1>
    We have our usual files (BUILD, WORKSPACE, main.py)
    and a new directory called mylib that has the following files in it:
    <ul>
      <li>test.py</li>
<pre><code class="python">
import unittest
from mylib.x import getX

class TestGetX(unittest.TestCase):
  def testValue(self) -> None:
    self.assertEqual(getX(), 'String to test the output against')

if __name__ == '__main__':
  unittest.main()
</code></pre>   
        We invoke the unit test in the last line.

      <p>
        <li>x.py</li>
        It can be any python file. For this example, we've
        created x.py and referenced it in BUILD.
      </p>

      <li>BUILD</li>
<pre><code class="python">
py_library (
  name = "x",
  srcs = ["x.py"],
  visibility = ["//:__pkg__"]
)
</code></pre>      
      We need to specify that the specific files are <code>visible</code>
      to the package at the root of the project.
<pre><code class="python">
py_test (
  name = "test",
  srcs = "test.py",
  deps = [":x"],
)  
</code></pre>      
    </ul>

    We modify the main BUILD file as follows:
<pre><code class="python">
py_binary (
  name = "main",
  srcs = ["main.py"],
  deps = ["//mylib:x"]
)
</code></pre>
    Now, we can directly use the library in main:
    <code>from mylib.x import getX</code> 
    (let's assume getX is a function in x.py)
  </subsection>
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Terminal commands</h1>
  Bazel sorts out its package dependencies by itself for itself to run.

  <subsection id="4.0"><h1>The basic commands</h1>
    The following works for python as well, but here there are specific
    details that only apply to c++.
<pre><code class="c++">
// Build everything in the root directory.
bazel build //...

// Run the binary executable.
bazel run //:main

// Clear bazel's cache of all the build artefacts.
// This is how it knows what changes have been made between builds.
bazel clean

// To see which subcommands Bazel invokes when doing the build.
bazel build //:main -s
</code></pre>

    The different subcommands that Bazel uses for the simple build include
    (Look for the keyword <code>SUBCOMMAND</code> in the output):
    <ul>
      <li>Compiling</li>
      You'll see the <code>PATH</code>, <code>PWD</code>,
      then the compilation command which starts with the path to the
      compiler (example: <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code>) followed by 
      different compilation commands.
  
      <p>
        An object file is stored in <code>bazel-out</code>
        (not directly, but in other sub directories).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <li>Linking</li>
        Links with the parameter file (extension <code>.params</code>)
        found in <code>bazel-bin</code>. This file is readable. 
        It outputs the binary file and takes in the object file
        created in the compilation step. We can see the other linker
        options being used.
      </p>
    </ul>
  
<pre><code class="c++">
// Compiling without any optimisation.
bazel build //:main --copt=-O0 -s
</code></pre>    
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="4.1"><h1>Unit test</h1>
<pre><code class="python">
# Run all tests within the root of the project.  
bazel test //...

# To see the errors in the test.
bazel test //... --test_output=errors
</code></pre>    
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="4.2"><h1>Example commands</h1>
<pre><code class="bash">
bazel build //estimation/...
ls bazel-bin/estimation/
bazel run //estimation:estimateResUsingRLS  
</code></pre>
