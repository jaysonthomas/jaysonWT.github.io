  A <i>probability distribution</i> is a list of events with their associated probabilities. It is a function that maps from the outcomes to their corresponding probabilities. A <i>distribution</i> aims to answer the question: what is the most likely event?

  <p>
    A probability distribution divides/distributes the whole <i>probability mass</i> (equal to 1) of a random variable across its possible outcomes, the variable's sample space. When the outcomes are discrete, the probability distribution function is called a <code>probability mass function</code>.
  </p>

  <subsection id="0.0"><h1>Mass</h1>
    <i>Mass</i> is the quantity of matter in a physical body. Example uses: a mass of cyclists, the film has mass appeal. Mass is also a measure of an object's inertia, its resistance to acceleration when a net force is applied.

  $$
    F_x(u) = p(x \leq u)
  $$

  The function describes the probability that a random variable $x$ is less than or equal to $u$. 
  
  <p>
    A <code>limit</code> is a value toward which an expression converges as one or more variables approach certain values.
  </p>

  $F$ will be monotonically increasing. The limit of $F$ as $u$ goes to $-\infty$ is $0$, and the limit as $u$ goes to $+\infty$ is $1$. The index to the function is $u$, but it is sub-scripted by $x$ to indicate which random variable is being characterised by the probability that the value of that random variable is less than $u$ or not.

<section id="2"><h1>Probability density function</h1>
  $$
    f_x(u) = \frac{d}{du}F_x(u)
  $$
  It's the derivative of a CDF w.r.t. its index. 

  $$
    \text{Probability density} = \text{Slope of CDF} = \frac{\text{Probability of interval}}{\text{Interval length}}
  $$

      Uniform PDF for the position $x$ of a vehicle
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    From the image, the vehicle has a probabiliy density of $0.5$ for $0 \leq x \geq 2$, and $0$ everywhere else. The probability that the vehicle is in the region between 0 and 2 is found by calculating the area under the curve which would be $2*0.5$.
  </p>
  
  The probability that a random variable will take a value between $x_1$ and $x_2$ is given by the integral of the probability density function from $x_1$ to $x_2$:

  $$
    p(x_1 &lt x &lt x_2) = \int^{x_2}_{x_1}f_x(x)dx = \int^{x_2}_{x_1}p(x)dx
  $$

  <p>
    $f_x(x)$ isn't the probability, and it can be greater than $1$. This density function is often written as $p(x)$. To be a <i>proper density</i>, $f_x(u)$ has to be greater than or equal to $0$, and the integral under the distribution has to be equal to $1$. <i>Normalization</i> implies finding a constant multiplier in front of this density function to make it integrate to $1$.
