<section id="0"><h1>2D drone example</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>State variables and control input</li>
    The drone will be constrained in the vertical direction, so it won't be allowed to go up or down. It is allowed to move horizontally and have a roll.
    $$
      x_t = \begin{bmatrix} \phi \\ \dot{y} \\ y \end{bmatrix}
      \qquad
      u_t = [\phi]
    $$

    The physics is simplified to allow for simpler math - instead of thinking of forces and moments, we're just going to have one control input which sets the roll angle directly $\phi$. 

    <div class="container">

    The thrust is assumed to be constant and equal to 1 as is the mass. To accelerate to the right, we set some roll angle, and some portion of the thrust equal to $sin(\phi)$ will cause the vehicle to accelerate. The new $\phi$ is whatever we set the control input to be i.e. the phi component of the control input. In this example, the control input has just the 1 component.

    <p>
    <li>State transition function</li>
    $$
      g(x_t, u_t, \Delta{t}) =
      \begin{bmatrix}
        u_{t, \phi} \\
        x_{t,\dot{y}} - sin(x_{t,\phi}) \times \Delta{t} \\
        x_{t,y} + x_{t,\dot{y}} \times \Delta{t}
      \end{bmatrix}

      = \begin{bmatrix}
            g_{\phi} \\
            g_{\dot{y}} \\
            g_y
          \end{bmatrix}
    $$

    $- sin(x_{t,\phi})$ is the acceleration of the drone. $\phi$ is written as $x_{t,\phi}$ to emphasise that $\phi$ is part of the state vector $x$.

    <p>
      In the 1D case, we could write $g$ as a linear equation (constant $A_t$ times $x_t$, plus constant $B_t$ times $u_t$). $sin(x_{t,\phi})$ cannot be factored into the $A$ and $B$ matrices that don't depend on the state, which means a Kalman Filter cannot be used as the estimation algorithm. To use a Kalman Filter here, we need a linear approximation of the system that's linearised around the current state of the vehicle. 
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <li>Jacobian of the state transition function</li>
    To linearise $g$, we take its Jacobian with respect to $x$, both of which are $3 \times 1$ vectors. The result will a $3 \times 3$ matrix of partial derivatives. The Jacobian tells us how each of the components of $g$ change as we change each of the components of the state vector. 

    $$\begin{align*}
      g'(x_t, u_t, \Delta{t}) &= 
      \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{\partial{g_{\phi}}}{\partial{x_{\phi}}}
        & \frac{\partial{g_{\phi}}}{\partial{x_{\dot{y}}}}
        & \frac{\partial{g_{\phi}}}{\partial{x_{y}}}

        \\
        \frac{\partial{g_{\dot{y}}}}{\partial{x_{\phi}}}
        & \frac{\partial{g_{\dot{y}}}}{\partial{x_{\dot{y}}}}
        & \frac{\partial{g_{\dot{y}}}}{\partial{x_{y}}}

        \\
        \frac{\partial{g_{y}}}{\partial{x_{\phi}}}
        & \frac{\partial{g_{y}}}{\partial{x_{\dot{y}}}}
        & \frac{\partial{g_{y}}}{\partial{x_{y}}}
      \end{bmatrix} \\

      &= \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 0 \\
        -cos(x_{\phi})\Delta{t} & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & \Delta{t} & 1
      \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}$$

    In the first row of the Jacobian, the partial derivatives of the $\phi$ component of $g$ is calculated with respect to each of the components of $x$

    <p>
      In the linear 1D example, the state transition function was linear. In that case taking the derivative of $g$ with respect to $x$ just gives the $A$ matrix, and this $A$ matrix doesn't actually depend on the state of the vehicle. Here, however, the matrix changes depending on the state of the vehicle, more specifically it depends on $\phi$. In general, the Jacobian represents the best linear approximation of the state transition function near the state $x$.

    <li>Non linear measurement model</li>
    <div class="container">
      <figure>

    </div>

    Imagine there is a big vertical wall at some position $wall_{y}$ and it extends infinitely upwards and downwards. The drone has a range sensor that points to the right and measures the distance to the wall. When the drone's roll angle is 0, we'd expect the sensor to give us a measured value of $wall_{y}$, minus the drone's y position, $x_{y}$. If the drone rolls by some angle $>0$, then we'd expect the sensor to return some number that's greater than $wall_{y} - x_y$. 
    
    <p>
      The true sensor measurement will be noisy. The measurement model takes a state (can be the estimated one) as input and returns an expected value of what the sensor will read:

      $$
        h(x) = \begin{bmatrix}
                \frac{wall_{y} - x_y}{cos{x_{\phi}}}
              \end{bmatrix}
      $$
    </p>
    </p>

    <p>
    <li>Jacobian of the measurement model</li>
    $h$ is non-linear since it has a $cos$. To use the measurement model in an EKF, we need to linearise the model around the current state. 

    <p>
      The Jacobian will be the derivative of the measurement model ($1 \times 1$) with respect to the state vector ($1 \times 3$), which will result in a $1 \times 3$ matrix with elements that are the partial derivatives of $h$ w.r.t. the different components of the state vector.
    </p>

    $$\begin{align*}
      h'(x_t) &= 
      \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{\partial{h}}{\partial{x_{\phi}}}
        & \frac{\partial{h}}{\partial{x_{\dot{y}}}}
        & \frac{\partial{h}}{\partial{x_{y}}}
      \end{bmatrix} \\

      &= \begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{sin{x_{\phi}}}{cos^2{x_{\phi}}}(wall_y - x_y)
        & 0
        & \frac{-1}{cos{x_{\phi}}}
      \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align*}$$

    <li>EKF Predict</li>
    For the Kalman filter predict function, $G_t$ was constant and just equal to the $A$ matrix. The g prime function wasn't very interesting since it actually ignored the current state of the vehicle. But with the non-linear case, we have to calculate the Jacobian every time we do the predict step; which is then used to propagate the covariance forward. 

    <p>
    <li>EKF Update</li>
    Compute $H_t$ using $h'$, which is used to compute the Kalman gain. We then compare the measurement to the expected measurement $h(\bar{\mu}_t$) similar to the KF.
