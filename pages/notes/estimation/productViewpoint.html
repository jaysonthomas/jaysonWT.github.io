<section id="0"><h1>Introduction</h1>
  <subsection id="0.0"><h1>Definition</h1>
    The goal of estimation is to come up with an estimate $\hat{x}$ for some unknown state $x$, both of which are vectors. Estimation:
    <ul>
      <li>Is a temporal process - things need to be integrated over time.</li>
      <li>
        Is a process of managing uncertainty. It is not 100% certain to know where an object is for example.
      </li>
    </ul> 
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="0.1"><h1>The need for estimation</h1>
    To quantify uncertainty. The goal is to make a very tight distribution, 
    so that a robot is more certain of its state. The real world (bot and environment) is uncertain in the following ways:
    
    <subsubsection><h1>Stochastic</h1>
      The effect of actions can have uncertain outcomes due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors.

      <p>
        A vehicle intending to follow a certain path might get blown to one side by a gust of wind or suddenly stop working. It is not possible to know when an uncertain event could occur that could then cause a state change. 
      </p>
    </subsubsection>

    <subsubsection><h1>Partially observable</h1>
      The real worl is only partially observable. There is uncertainty about the current state of the world. 
      
      <p>
        Where is the vehicle? What's behind a particular object? It is hard to know everything about the world.
      </p>
    </subsubsection>
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="0.2"><h1>Applications</h1>
    We only need sensor feedback if we want the drone to be autonomous. 
    To be autonomous, the robot needs to know the following (RHS of table). 
    Estimation plays a role in all these problems.
    <p><table class="table1 center">
      <tr>
        <th>Type of problem</th>
        <th>Knowledge of</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Localisation, navigation</td>
        <td>
          Itself
          <br>
          Where the vehicle is, its attitude  
          <br>
          How fast it's going
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mapping</td>
        <td>
          The environment
          <br>
          What is around me?
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tracking</td>
        <td>
          Others
          <br>
          Where are the other vehicles?
          <br>
          How fast are they going?
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table></p>
    E.g. estimation is what makes GPS work so well, Apollo spacecraft, 
    how the phone screen orients itself.
