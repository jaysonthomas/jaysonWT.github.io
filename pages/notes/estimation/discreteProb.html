<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Discrete Probability</h1>

<section id="0"><h1>Example</h1>
  We are running tests to see if a bot comes to a stop at exactly the right 
  point. We run the test a 1000 times. At the end of each test we
  measure its position w.r.t. the target. The results are as shown 
  <a href="https://t.ly/3nOj">here</a>.

  $$
    P(Bot\, stops\, 1mm\, from\, target) = 
    \frac{Frequency\, of\, particular\, event}
    {Total\, number\, of\, events} = \frac{900}{1000} = 0.9
  $$

  Random variable, $X$, represents the event, i.e. the error in the final position.
  <br>
  Example, $x_2 = 2000$, $P(X=x_2) = 0.05$.
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Random variable</h1>
  When actually measured, a <i>random variable</i> takes on a value at random, each with a certain probability. For example, the side on which a coin lands is a random variable with two possible values: heads and tails, each with a probability of 0.5. It takes on integer values to represent an event if the event's name is in string format

  <p>
    A <i>deterministic variable</i> is a variable with only one possible fixed value at any given time. For example, a person's age is a deterministic variable.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Z-score</h1>
  It is the number of standard deviations from the mean.
  Steps in calculating:
  <ul>
    <li>
      For each number: subtract the mean, i.e. centre the distribution
      at the mean. This difference will give us each number's deviation
      from the mean.
    </li>
    <li>
      Given a deviation, to find out how many standard deviations that is,
      divide it by a single standard deviation.
    </li>
    $$
      zScore = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
    $$
  </ul>

  Love the illustration <a href="https://t.ly/KsMH">here</a>.
  <a href="https://t.ly/hEXC">This example</a> is genius.

<section id="3"><h1>Normalisation</h1>
  Different types of normalisation and when to use each: 
  <a href="https://t.ly/PN_i">Ref</a>.

  <p>
    The relative frequency of events may not be in the range of 0 to 1. 
    But we can make the relative frequency sum to one by normalizing - dividing the 
    probability of each event by the sum of probabilities of all the events.
    A probability is normalized when the probabilities sum to 1.0.
    Any mathematically correct distribution must be normalized, but un-normalized 
    distributions can also be useful if we just want to compare relative probabilities.

    <li>Z-score</li>
    It is similar to mapping 100seconds to the equivalent number of minutes.
    Since a minute is 60s, we divide 100 by 60 to get the answer. Here,
    each x-axis division is a standard deviation (denominator). The numerator
    is the deviation from the mean along the x-axis scale.
