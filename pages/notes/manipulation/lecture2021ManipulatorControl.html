<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 3"><h1>Manipulator control</h1>

<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  In <a href=lecture2021ForceControl.html>force control</a>, the robot was assumed to be a point. Here, the whole robot is considerd focusing on the force control aspects of manipulator control. 

  <p>
    For the pushing-a-book-on-a-table task, there is a sweet spot where the right amount of force needs to be applied to maintain frictional contact between the hand and the book so that the hand doesn't slide away on the book; but the downward force cannot be too high preventing the book from being able to slide on the table.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Stiffness control in end-effector coordinates</h1>
  How do we go from implementing the controller at the joints to implementing it just 
  at the end effector? So instead of affecting the dynamics in $q$ we want to write 
  the dynamics at the EE. We want the fingertip to act like a MSD.

  <p>
    This is sometimes also called <i>cartesian/EE stiffness control</i>. So how do we 
    take those basic equations and impose a dynamics in the EE. We have the end position 
    of the arm given by some kinematic function of $q$: 
    $$
      p^c = f_{kin}(q)
    $$
    The end contact point is determined by the joint angles. This is the relationship 
    we get to work with and we would like to impose/achieve the following goal:
    $$\begin{equation}
      m\ddot{p}^c + b\dot{p}^c + k(p^c-p^{c_d}) = f^c_{ext}
    \label{eq:goal2}
    \end{equation}$$
  </p>

  <subsection id="1.0"><h1>Change of coordinates</h1>
    We have our joint angles in $q$ coordinates and we have to somehow change to $p$
    coordinates in order to achieve our goal. 

    <p>
      It's very easy in the derivation (starting from the initial eqs.) to end up at a dead end. 
      But the following method which uses the right way to change coordinates 
      (i.e. using the Jacobian) will get us there:
    </p>
    <equation><h1>The right way to change from joint to position coordinates</h1>
      $$\begin{equation}
        M_c(q) = (J^c(q)M^{-1}(q)J^{c^T}(q))^{-1}
      \label{eq:opSpaceForm}
      \end{equation}$$
      $M_c$ is the EE mass or the effective mass.
      <br>
      $M$ is the mass of the original system.
      <br><br>

      This transformation is often called <i>operation space form of the dynamics</i>. 
      Super useful! 
      It's not surprising that we use the Jacobian to change coordinates.
      The Jacobian $J^c(q)$ is given by:
      $$
        \dot{p}^c = J^c(q)\dot{q}
      $$
      Looking at (\ref{eq:opSpaceForm}), what's maybe a little surprising is that we can 
      write the equations of 
      motion in the EE frame as a function of the original coordinates and the Jacobian.
    </equation>

    We get a new set of equations with an altered mass matrix, an altered coriolis matrix 
    on the LHS (which still depends on $q$ and $\dot{q}$), an altered torque matrix 
    ($F$) plus $u$ in the new coordinates plus external forces. 
    $$\begin{equation}
      M_c(q)\ddot{p}^c + C_c(q,\dot{q}) = F^c_g(q) + u_c + f^c_{ext}
    \label{eq:resultOpSpaceForm}
    \end{equation}$$

    (\ref{eq:opSpaceForm}) was the magic step we needed. Now if we start working with 
    the new dynamics (\ref{eq:resultOpSpaceForm}) in the operation/EE space then we can 
    just do feedback cancellation in this lower space.
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="1.1"><h1>Is (\ref{eq:opSpaceForm}) invertible?</h1>
    What are the conditions that would be required for the matrix in (\ref{eq:opSpaceForm}) 
    be invertible? 

    <p>
      In general we'd expect $(AA^T)^{-1}$ to exist if $A$ has full row rank. 
      So let's first ask does the Jacobian have full row rank? We can certainly find 
      singular configurations where it doesn't (when the arm is stretched out). 
      But in all reasonable parts of the workspace, $J$ tends to be. 
      For instance it could be: $J(q)=3\times nq$ if we're trying to do EE stuff; 
      it tends to be full row rank and low column rank because it's a long short matrix. 
      The mass matrix is positive definite so that is going to be well conditioned too.
    </p>

    So, the matrix should have an inverse as long as $J$ doesn't go singular; which is as 
    it should be intuitively. If we just try to start jamming $J$ transpose in our EoM
    we'll get stuck. But it must be the case that if we were to push on the EE of a 
    physical contraption it will push back on us with some physical force. The force that 
    it pushes back with is configuration (LHS of (\ref{eq:resultOpSpaceForm})) dependent 
    - there will be some big complicated set of mass which will more or less work 
    against me in each axis depending on the configuration of the mass.

    <p>
      What is the ability of the arm to produce force at the EE in a singular configuration? 
      The controller can't produce force in the direction the arm is stretched out 
      instantaneously but it can produce a forced dot. So we have to be careful if we start 
      writing controllers similar to (\ref{eq:resultOpSpaceForm}) in such singular 
      configurations - people tend to write it in a constrained least squares form and 
      put some boundaries on it. Try not to take the inverse of the Jacobian as in 
      (\ref{eq:opSpaceForm}) in singular conditions or be careful about it. 
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="1.2"><h1>Null space of the controller (\ref{eq:resultOpSpaceForm})</h1>
    If we write a controller that tells the robot to act like a certain dynamics in the 
    xyz configuration, but say the robot has 7 DOF, then we've still got to specify 
    something for the joints (so that the joints don't get into an odd configuration and 
    bump somewhere for example). The same way in our Jacobian based controller, we talked 
    about putting a secondary objective in the null space (something for instance to stay 
    in a comfortable joint configuration, example: EE position is fixed, but joints are moving) 
    we need to do something similar to stabilise the null space of this controller too.

    <p>
      So choose $u_c$ such that (\ref{eq:resultOpSpaceForm}) almost 
      equals (\ref{eq:goal2}):

      $$
        M_c(q)\ddot{p}^c + C(q, \dot{q}) + K_p(p^c - p^{c^d}) + .. = 
      $$
      And I think, also add in nullspace stabilisation to the mix.
    </p>

    The fact that we tend to not change $M$, $C$ and that they are configuration dependent, 
    means that, instantaneously, we can make our robot act like a MSD system. The mass 
    that it acts like though will be configuration dependent. Almost always! In the 
    quasi-static analysis case, if the accelerations are small, if we're going to push 
    and see how far the robot deflects (i.e. how much we can push it) before it hits a 
    new steady state and stops, the mass doesn't matter there; the inertial terms 
    don't matter in the static analysis. But in the dynamic analysis, if we start trying to 
    understand the dynamics of our robot then $M$ and $C$ are going to be notable; 
    maybe not hugely important. It would be beautiful and clean to make them somehow constant, 
    a function of $q$ but we tend to not do that. There are theoretical limits on how 
    much we can change the mass before we write a controller that is unstable. 
    Neville Hogan has some great surveys on that.
