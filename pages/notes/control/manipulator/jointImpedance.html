<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Joint impedance control</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  Most controllers choose to use the initial mass and coriollis terms in their desired dynamics. $M, C$ always go together (even in reality) and are similar to the $ma$ in $F=ma$. It typically requires high bandwidth to cancel out $M, C$ and achieve good accuracy of the mass. A control method that involves changing $M, C$ is called <i>joint impedance control</i>.
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Example: Iiwa</h1>
  Iiwa does much more than just GC. In joint-impedance control mode, Iiwa also does friction compensation and some subtle stuff at the actuator level to cancel out the effective dynamics of the arm.  

  <p>
    It does some amount of mass cancellation but actually it only compensates for the masses of the rotors and not for the whole robot. It's actually a very subtle, carefully designed control - $M$, $C$ are technically changed a little bit but not in the way of making a different effective mass. It's very similar to the feedback cancellation 
    story but it's trying to do a little bit less (because it's not cancelling $M$,$C$ of the whole robot) and it's even more robust because of it.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Example: Opening a dishwasher door</h1>
  The joint trajectory that iiwa is programmed to follow during the opening motion would deviate significantly depending on how accurately the location of the dishwasher door is modelled and captured. Even to open the hinge of the dishwasher, if the arm is trying to move down exactly based on some kinematic constraint given by the door of the dishwasher, if it is a little bit off (i.e. the door doesn't open the way it is modeled or the door handle isn't in the same place the model expects it to be) then it pays a lot to be flexible enough to just follow whatever contour is given by the actual position of the dishwasher and not by the model's course approximation.

  <p>
    Whilst opening the door, the fingers will slip off if the arm is in too stiff of a mode. Similarly when the door is pushed down (to lay it flat when open) the arm would still be in a joint impedance mode - it wouldn't be tracking the position trajectory super accurately but would still be able to accomplish the task.
