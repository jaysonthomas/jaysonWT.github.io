there are many ways to solve the Dynamics and what we're going to use here are are the Newton Oiler equations these are essentially a vector version of the fals ma equation that you learned in high school um there are other methods to do this a common one being the lrange equations which are typically taught in more advanced Dynamics classes in college but we'll start we'll keep it simple and just use the uh fancy version of equal Ma so this side of the equation is f which is the sum of forces so we have the horizontal forces and in this picture what we've drawn in are the scalar values so this is just the how much force what's the What's the magnitude What's the magnitude of this and now we're going to assign it directions so Force magnitude multiplied by unit Vector direction again we do the same thing in the vertical Direction multiply it by J hat or the vertical Direction on the left on the right hand side we have mass time acceleration where acceleration is just the second derivative of the position of the center of mass so that was that P1 Vector we had up here we take two derivatives it now becomes an acceleration vector and we'll cover later how we how we write that out we can then apply the exact same procedure to the pole so we'll zoom out a little bit here and we get we have three forces we see the forces here assigned to the correct direction and again mass times acceleration now you might think that we're done at this point but it's always good to check and see how many unknowns you have and how many equations you have so here we actually have three unknown forces the normal force and the two components of the tension force and we also have two unknown accelerations X do and Theta double dot that gives us five unknowns and this equation is in two dimensions and this equations in two Dimensions so that's four equations it turns out that forces and accelerations at least for simple problems like this will enter in linearly so if we want to solve for five unknowns we're going to need five equations we get the fifth equation by doing um what I would call a torque balance um another word for it is angular momentum balance and it's very similar to fals ma but it's just torque equals um some some angular acceleration times angular inertia now there's a lot of ways to write this out and I've used the more General Vector version of this which is that the torqus are going to represented by a relative position Vector crossed with a force Vector um so in this case we have P2 minus P1 which is a vector pointing from here out to here and we also have a weight Vector here the cross product is simply taking this vector and kind of projecting it perpendicular to this um vector and then multiplying them so it's essentially the torque that weight is producing about this point now I'd like to stop and just point out something that's kind of important which is that whenever you do a torque balance you have to pick a point to about which your torque are being summed and here I've picked this pivot point and that's not an accident it turns out to make the math a lot easier because I have these two unknown forces but since they're both traveling through the point when I compute the torque produced by them it's zero because there's no moment arm and that just makes the math a little bit easier but you could actually do this at at any point and it would still work now the right hand side of the equation is a little bit complicated there's a bunch of ways to write it and um essentially you have to capture some rotational inertia times some rotational acceleration the way that I like to do this is you have the relative position of the center of mass and then you multiply it or you cross it with the mass times the translational acceleration of that point so here P2 is the center of mass because it's a point mass and so we just have mass times that acceleration crossed with that vector and that's the rate of change of angular momentum of this link now another way that you might see to do this is to explicitly compute the moment of inertia of this about that point and then multiply that by Theta double dot and it turns out that that'll give you the same answer it's just a different way of writing it out one thing to keep in mind when you do it this way is that if you're not working with a point Mass you have to add another term for the rotational inertia multiplied by this ex second derivative of the angle for any moment of inertia about the center of mass since we've chosen a point mass that term drops out in this deration so that concludes the first part of this derivation and I'll come back in a second video and cover how we do all the algebra to convert these equations into the desired accelerations that we would like
