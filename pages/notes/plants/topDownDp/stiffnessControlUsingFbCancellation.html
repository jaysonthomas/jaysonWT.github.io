<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Stiffness control implemented using feedback cancellation</h1>
<section id="0"><h1>Overview</h1>
  Feedback cancelling control is a practical powerful idea to change a system's dynamics, if the change is:
  <ul>
    <li>Local, within reason</li>
    <li>Small</li>
  </ul>
  
  A big complicated robot can be made to act like a point robot at the end using a <i>stiffness controller</i>, wherein the end-effector's interactions to external forces are programed. 
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Example: Double pendulum - joint stiffness control</h1>
  Starting at the joint level, a PD position controller for a DP would look like:
  $$\begin{equation}
    u = K_p(q^d-q) - K_d(\dot{q}^d-\dot{q})
  \end{equation}$$

  <p>
    The behaviour/interaction of say joint 2 within a DP can be configured such that it would seem like it has rotary springs of a certain stiffnes $k$, and damping $b$ when perturbed (the unit of each term is in torque):      
    $$\begin{equation}
      M(q)\ddot{q} + C(q,\dot{q}) + K_p(q-q^d) + K_d(\dot{q}^d-\dot{q}) = \tau_{ext}
    \end{equation}$$
  </p>

  Using the same philosophy from feedback cancellation, the controller can be achieved by:
  <ul>
    <li>Cancelling out the dynamics that are not desired</li>
    Cancel the gravity compensation term $\tau_g$ but retain $M, C$ terms.
    
    <li>Inserting new desired dynamics</li>
    i.e. PD control.
  </ul>   
  
  The controller would look like:
  $$\begin{equation}
    u = -\tau_g(q) + K_p(q^d-q) - K_d(\dot{q}^d-\dot{q})
  \end{equation}$$

  This control replaces the effect of gravity (i.e. <i>gravity compensation</i>) with a stiffness interaction.
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Benefit of having gravity compensation</h1>
  In practice, the difference in having a controller with just PD control and no 
  gravity compensation is huge. In DP, if we wanted to hold the pendulum in a horizontal 
  position (i.e. choose a stiffness that allows us to do that) where gravity is pulling down; 
  if we don't have GC, the $K_p$ term will need to do the work of cancelling out gravity and 
  hence will have a large value.

  <p>
    If we want to hold the DP at an offset from the horizontal position, we would still 
    need to keep $K_p$ very large in the PD controller. If the DP were in the downward 
    position, we wouldn't have required a large $K_p$ to get a reasonable performance 
    compared to the horizontal position. But, we end up with an excessive value all over
    the workspace.
  </p>

  So, if we want reasonable performance all over the state space with just a 
  PD controller, we have to choose $K_p$ to be very large and $K_d$ to be very large 
  as well just to damp the effect of having a large $K_p$ term. If we subtract out gravity 
  i.e. we use GC in our controller, then we can choose $K_p$, $K_d$ to be much lower 
  and we can be much more responsive. In practice when people are running controllers 
  without GC and we bump into the robot, 
  it may trigger a fault and power down. If we do it with GC, it will be soft enough 
  to get out of the way.
