<section id="0"><h1>Forward Kinematics</h1>
  $$
    X^B = f^B_{kin}(q)
  $$  

  In this mathematical equation (actual implementation in code is different):
  <br>
  $q$ is the vector of positions.
  <br>
  $X$ is the pose in the world.
  <br>
  $f_{kin}$ is the FK of the body.
  <br>
  $B$ stands for body.
  <br>
  $G$ stands for gripper if it was used instead of $B$.    
  
  <p>
    The mapping from joint angles to poses is called the <i>Forward Kinematics problem</i>. Looking at the 2D rotation matrix above:
    $$
      R(\theta) = \begin{bmatrix}
      c & -s \\
      s & c     
      \end{bmatrix}
    $$
  </p>

  If we have joint angle $\theta$ and we want to turn it into a rotation or a pose then it is almost always going to be a nonlinear map from the joint angles into the poses. The matrix above is maybe the simplest example of it.
</section>

<section id="1"><h1>Inverse Kinematics</h1>
  <i>Inverse kinematics</i> is a nonlinear complicated function that helps to go from poses in the world to joint positions.
  $$
    q = (f^B)^{-1}(X^B)
  $$
  
  It is not necessarily a unique mapping - there can be multiple $q$s that get the same pose in the world. There could also be no solutions. Going the other way is more straight forward.   
  
  <p>
    IK is oftentimes not used directly since if the IK engine gives slightly different answers for very similar poses, then it might involve arm movements that jump around to different solutions. It is normally used with additional requirements for continuity/smoothness/centering etc.
  </p>

  An example: if an arm had multiple joint angle solutions for a given pose for the hand, then the IK engine could ask for different joint angles (for the same hand pose) every 0.0001 seconds which wouldn't be good.
