  <subsection id="1.0"><h1>Definition</h1>
    Estimation:
    <ul>
      <li>Is a temporal process - so you integrate things over time.</li>
      <li>
        It's a process of managing uncertainty. We can never be 100% certain 
        where the robot is.
      </li>
    </ul> 
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="1.1"><h1>The need for estimation</h1>
    To quantify uncertainty. The goal is to make a very tight distribution, 
    so that a robot is more certain of its state.
    The real world (bot and environment) is uncertain in the following ways:
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is stochastic. The effect of actions can have 
        uncertain outcomes due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors.
      </li>
      We might intend for a vehicle to follow a certain path, but it might
      get blown to one side by a gust of wind or suddenly stop working.
      This change in state is a source of uncertainty, we never know when it's 
      going to happen.
      <br><br>

      <li>
        It is only partially observable. There is uncertainty about 
        the current state of the world.
      </li>
      Where is the vehicle? What's behind that building over there? We can't
      know everything about the world.
    </ul>
  </subsection>

  <subsection id="1.2"><h1>Applications</h1>
    We only need sensor feedback if we want the drone to be autonomous. 
    To be autonomous, the robot needs to know the following (RHS of table). 
    Estimation plays a role in all these problems.
    <p><table class="table1 center">
      <tr>
        <th>Type of problem</th>
        <th>Knowledge of</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Localisation, navigation</td>
        <td>
          Itself
          <br>
          Where the vehicle is, its attitude  
          <br>
          How fast it's going
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Mapping</td>
        <td>
          The environment
          <br>
          What is around me?
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Tracking</td>
        <td>
          Others
          <br>
          Where are the other vehicles?
          <br>
          How fast are they going?
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table></p>
    E.g. estimation is what makes GPS work so well, Apollo spacecraft, 
    how the phone screen orients itself.

  <subsection id="1.3"><h1>How to create an estimator</h1>
    We use <code>Bayes rule</code> which is a method:
    <ul>
      <li>To integrate data over time</li>
      <li>
        To take multiple sources of information, and come up with a distribution 
        that is the best reflection of what the state might be
      </li>
    </ul>
    Bayes rule relies on probability at its core to quantify uncertainty.
    There are other ways, such as confidence scores, fuzzy logic etc.
  </subsection>

<section id="2"><h1>Estimating parameters from data</h1>
  We do parameter estimation when coming up with a model for a sensor.
  For example, if we mount a laser rangefinder exactly one meter from a wall,
  and use it to measure the distance, we probably won't get a measured distance of 
  exactly one meter. It will likely be slightly above, or slightly below.

  <p>
    But if we repeat this measurement many times, we'll likely find that on average 
    the sensor does measure the correct distance plus or minus some error.
    That error is also called <code>sensor noise</code>,
    and it's often best modeled as a Gaussian random variable with some mean ideally zero,
    and some standard deviation.
  </p>

  In order to use that sensor most effectively,
  we need an accurate estimate of what the parameters of that distribution are.
  We can't know the exact values of the parameters of a distribution given some data,
  but we can compute estimates of the parameters in a variety of ways.

  <p>
    For example, a Gaussian is parameterized by $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$.
    We'll write the estimates of these parameters as $\hat{x}$, and $\hat\sigma^2$ respectively.
    Now, let's imagine that we have some Gaussian that's generating samples from $x$,
    with probability density $p(x)$, and we don't know $\mu$, or $\sigma$.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img style="height:150px; width:auto"
    src="../../../figures/drone/14_estimatingParametersExample.png"/>
  </figure>
  
  If we repeatedly draw from this distribution to collect samples of data,
  we'll likely get more data near the mean, and fewer samples out on the tails of the gaussian.
  Using a technique called the <code>method of moments</code>,
  we can show that if we have samples $\{x_1, x_2,.., x_n\}$, then 
  $$\hat{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1}x_i$$
  $$\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\hat{x})^2$$

  <p>
    It's quite convenient that the mean of the distribution matches the expected value,
    and the variance of the distribution matches that variance.
