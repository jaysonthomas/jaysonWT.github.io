<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 0"><h1>Least Squares</h1>

<section id="0"><h1>Definitions</h1>
  A <i>state</i> is a physical quantity that changes over time. <i>State estimation</i> (process of computing a state from a set of measurements) is used for localisation in autonomous driving. Position and orientation are states of a moving vehicle.

  <p>
    Related to state estimation is the idea of <i>parameter estimation</i>. A <i>parameter</i> is a physical quantity that is constant over time. The resistance of a particular resistor in the electrical sub-system of a vehicle would be a parameter.
  </p>

  Carl Friedrich Gauss' description of <code>Least Squares</code>:
  <br>
  The most probable value of an unknown parameter is that which minimizes the sum of squared errors between what we observe and what we expect multiplied by numbers that measure the degree of precision.

  <subsection id="0.0"><h1>Independent and identically distributed</h1>
    What does it mean for a set of random variables to be independent and identically distributed?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each random variable follows the same probability distribution and the variance of 
        any random variable does not depend on the other variables.
      </li>
      Close! It is true that, if the random variables all follow the same probability 
      distribution, each must have the same variance (which is fixed). 
      However, the term "i.i.d" refers to the statistical independence of any pair of 
      random variables.
      <p>
        <li>
          Each random variable follows the same probability distribution and all the variables 
          are mutually independent (i.e., the cross-covariance of any pair is zero).
        </li>
        Right! This relationship is shown on the last slide, where the entries on the main 
        diagonal of the matrix $R$ are the same and the off-diagonal entries are all 
        equal to zero.
      </p>
    </ul>

<section id="1"><h1>Assumptions in LS</h1>
  Things to keep in mind when making a measurement:
  <ul>
    <li>Sampling time</li>
    <li>Measurement model</li>
    <li>State of the system at the time of the measurement</li>
    <li>Accuracy of the measurements</li>
  </ul>

  With this in mind, the most basic least squares approach applied to estimating the state of a flying car, would make the following unrealistic assumptions:

  <ul>
    <li>The measurements come in all at once</li>
    <li>The underlying measurement model $H$ is noisy but linear</li>
    Measurements of things like orientation are rarely linear.
    <li>The vehicle is stationary</li>
    <li>Each measurement has an equal weight in the error equation</li>
    We care about each of the measurements equally.
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Uses</h1>
  Despite the over-simplifications/assumptions above, the estimation technique is common for calibration, finding the transform between two coordinate systems or model fitting.

  <ul>
    <li>Ordinary LS measurement variance</li>
    If the 4 resistance measurements are taken by different sensors;
    what do we mean when we say the variances are different: 

    <p>
      For each of the 4 sensors, take 100 measurements and work out the 
      variance. Variance is the sum of squared deviations from the mean times the probability of occurrence of the corresponding measurement. I'm guessing a manufacturer will need to provide this info when they do tests of measuring known physical properties. In most cases, they'd probably assume the probability of each of the 100 measurements is the same. So, the variance just becomes the mean of the squared deviations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <li>
        Just to confirm, when someone says the variance is $x$, it gives no indication
        of the accuracy right? It only gives an indication of the bias of each sensor
        from whatever the mean is. I think <a href="https://bit.ly/3VB6OnG">this post</a>
        is confirming my thoughts are correct. If the sensor is accurate, the mean
        is the actual value of the physical quantity.
      </li>
    </p>

    <li>Is sensor variance a measure of accuracy</li>
    Googling this question gave led to many interesting link in reasearch gate and
    different stack exchanges.

    <p>
      <li>
        If we're doing batch LS on $y=Hx+b$ instead of just $y=Hx$,
        does the formula change?
      </li>
      I think it's equivalent to $y=H_1x+H_2b$
    </p>
