<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 3"><h1>Gyroscope</h1>

<section id="0"><h1>Basics</h1>
  A gyroscope measures the angular rotation about an axis by measuring the Coriolis Force. <n>The coriolis force only shows up when the measurement device is in a rotating reference frame</n>.

  <p>
    The most common gyros are small <i>Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS)</i>  sensors called <i>Vibrating Structure Gyroscopes</i>. A different gyro in the form of a large ball or wheel that mechanically spins could also be attached to a vehicle. Changes to its motions can be measured as the vehicle rotates. But, these large mechanical systems are impractical for smaller vehicles.
  </p>

<section id="1"><h1>Coriolis force</h1>
  Imagine looking from above at a big spinning disk (like a merry-go-round) that's rotating with some angular velocity $\omega$. Imagine someone standing in the middle of the disc tried to throw a ball at the triangular target shown below:

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:120px; width:auto"
      src="../../../figures/physics/3_coriolisForceExplanation_target.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        The target
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  The ball doesn't care that the disk is rotating - it would move in a straight line and by the time it got to the edge of the disk, the target would have rotated far away from where it originally was. Here, the motion is observed from the world frame, which is an inertial frame. In this frame, there is no Coriolis Force.

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:120px; width:auto"
      src="../../../figures/physics/4_inertialVsRotatingFrame.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        Inertial vs Rotating frame of reference
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  Imagine standing on the triangular target and observing the motion of the ball. From this point of view (a rotating frame of reference), the ball would take a curved path. It would seem like the ball is being pushed sideways by some force, the <i>Coriolis Force</i> $F_c$.
</section>

<section><h1>Physical working</h1>
  Gyros work by having two tiny masses called <i>Proof Masses</i> that vibrate in opposite directions. When there is no rotation, these masses just move along a horizontal line i.e. they will have some horizontal velocity.

  <div class="container">
    <figure>
      <img style="height:70px; width:auto"
      src="../../../figures/physics/5_memsGyroVibratingMassesHorizontal.png"/>
      <figcaption>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  Imagine the sensor is rotating about an axis (through the centre of the sensor, into and perpendicular to the screen) with velocity $\omega$. If we paused the rotation of the sensor for an instant and captured its state (see below), the rotation vector and the horizontal velocity vectors being orthogonal to each other leads to a Coriolis Force pointing upwards on the right mass and one pointing downwards on the left mass. At any given time, the 2 masses move opposite to each other and hence experience forces in opposite directions.
  
  <p>
    This force is orthogonal to both the velocity and the rotation axis. The resulting motion of the proof masses will have a horizontal and a vertical component. 
  </p>

      <img style="height:90px; width:auto"
      src="../../../figures/physics/6_rotatingMemsGyro.png"/>
      <figcaption>
        Vibrating proof masses of a gyro that's rotating
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  By measuring this deflection in the vertical direction for both proof masses, the rotational rate of the sensor can be inferred.
</section>

<section id="1.1"><h1>Measurement model</h1>
  We can measure the effect of the coriolis force - the size of the force is a function of the rotational speed of the rotating reference frame, i.e. we can use a measurement of $F_c$ to infer $\omega$.

  $$
    |F_c| = f(\omega)
  $$

  A <i>measurement model</i> should also include a measure of how accurate the measurements are; in this case, that of $\omega$.
