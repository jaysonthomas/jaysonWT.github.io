<section id="1"><h1>Overview</h1>
  <ul>
    <p>
      <li>Reflected inertia</li>
      We can think of manipulators on a higher level, kinematically 
      (purely in terms of joint angles and end-effector positions), 
      as opposed to worrying about dynamics (joint torques and inertias)
      because there is a lower level PID control and a set of motor/gearbox 
      that ensures the required torque is always available to maintain 
      the desired position.
      <p>
        <b>Task</b><br>
        Make a simple pendulum swing to any position with minimal position
        error.
      </p>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <li>Differential IK optimisation</li>
      We can plan our trajectory in the ee space. But, we do need to calculate
      (for the lower level mechanism) the positions/velocities of the joints
      to achieve the ee requirements at every time step. The lower level 
      mechanism works in the joint space. We need to make sure to avoid kinematic
      singularities where we end up demanding very high speeds in the joint
      space. We need to come as close as possible to achieving the desired
      ee velocities.

      <p>
        <b>Task</b><br>
        A constant desired ee velocity is demanded for 7 continuous seconds.
        The aim is to get a robot arm to track that desired ee velocity whilst
        not violating its joint position, velocity and acceleration constraints.
      </p>
    </p>

    <p>
      <li>Planar manipulator</li>
      Using geometrical reasoning, derive the FK, jacobian of the FK map
      and the conditions for which the jacobian is singular for a 2 link manipulator.

      <p><b>Task</b><br>
        Visualise the FK-movement of a 2 link manipulator in the ee space. Reason 
        in which joint angle configurations would the manipulator attain singularity
        i.e. we wouldn't be able to invert the jacobian?
      </p>
    </p>

    <p>
      <li>Rigid transforms</li>
      The ee trajectory is dependent on how we plan to grasp an object. For which
      computing rigid transforms of frames in various reference frames is important.

      <p><b>Task</b><br>
        Design a simple grasp pose given an object's frame w.r.t. to a world frame.
        No visualisation yet.
      </p>
    </p>

    <p>
      <li>Robot painter</li>
      We bring everything together in this part - spatial transformations and interpolation
      between keyframes play a key role. But, under the hood, I'm sure a differential IK,
      closed loop control is involved. It is also interesting to see how to visualise
      different frames and play an animation in drake. It's good to see how to put together
      a working application (composition of different subsystems) in drake.      

      <p><b>Task</b><br>
        Design the gripper of a robot arm to follow a circular trajectory about a given
        center with its z axis always pointed towards the center of the trajectory.
        Compute the key frames first, then interpolate the trajectory from the key frames.

  <subsection><h1>Background knowledge</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Physics/The physical system</li>
      <p>
        <i>Dynamics</i> is the study of the effect that forces have
        on the motion of objects. <i>Statics</i> is the study of forces in
        the absence of changes in motion. 
        <br>
        <i>Direct-drive</i> means the motor's movements are directly 
        translated to the joint side.
        There is no gearing or that the gear ratio is 1.
      </p>
      <li>Control</li>
      <p>
        First order form of system dynamics: $\dot{x}=f(x,u)$ where $x$ is 
        the state vector, $u$ is the control input. There are various 
        parameters like $m$, $g$, $l$ involved in the equation.
      </p>
      <li>Pendulum specific</li>
      <p>
        The simple pendulum is perhaps the simplest abstraction of a 
        'manipulator'.
      </p>
      <equation><h1>Simple Pendulum</h1>
        $$x=[q,\dot{q}]^T$$
        $$u=\tau$$
        $$
          \frac{d}{dt} \begin{bmatrix}q \\ \dot{q}\end{bmatrix}
          = \begin{bmatrix}
            \dot{q}\\
            \frac{(\frac{-mglsin(q)}{N}+\tau)}
            {(\frac{I_ml^2}{N^2})N}
            \end{bmatrix}
        $$
        Without a motor and gearbox, the rotor inertia of the motor $I_m$
        and the gear ratio $N$ are 1.      
      </equation>
    </ul>
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection><h1>Steps</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Write the system dynamics with ideal input drive condition</li>
      That is, $I_m = N = 1$.
      <li>Include a motor and a gearbox into the system dynamics</li>
      <li>Decide on values for the different parameters</li>
      <li>Combine everything in drake</li>
      <p>
        Input to the plant (Pendulum with motor and gearbox)
        is the drive torque. Output is the new orientation/angular speed of the pendulum.
        The PID controller calculates the drive torque based on the 
        difference (error) between the measured and desired state.
        The logger logs all the states w.r.t. time (trajectory).
      </p>
      <li>Simulate the closed loop system</li>
      Advance the system in time.

    <ul>
      <li>Dynamics equation of a simple pendulum with an attached gear and motor.</li>
      Where do I get the equation from? What is the intuitive meaning behind it?
  
      <li>Motor side vs joint side dynamics?</li>
      <li>What happens in the direct-drive case?</li>
      Apparently, stability in this scenario, can only be achieved if the PID
      gains are high enough.
      
      <p>
        <li>Why is $sin\theta$ considered to induce non-linear behaviour?</li>
        <li>
          Intuitively, why does gravity have less of an effect on the system
          when there are gears/motor involved?
        </li>
      </p>
      <li>Go through brian douglas' introduction of 
        <a href="https://t.ly/V62f">state space equations</a></li>
        This is to understand why we include velocity in the state
        vector for a first order state space equation because that
        would involve calculating the acceleration.

<section id="3"><h1>Differential IK optimisation</h1>
  <subsection><h1>Background knowledge</h1>
    <p>
      <i>Kinematics</i> is a branch of physics concerned with the geometrically possible 
      movements of a body or a system of bodies without considering the forces and masses involved.
      <i>Robot manipulator kinematics</i> deals with how the robot joints need to move, 
      in a coordinate manner, to achieve the end-effector prescribed movement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Differential kinematics</i> relates the <i>velocities</i> of the manipulator components. 
      The standard approach to differential kinematics is to relate joint 
      and ee velocities through the Jacobian matrix, which allows the calculation of the ee 
      velocities given the joint velocities (<i>direct differential kinematics</i>) or, 
      to determine the joint velocities in order to move the end-effector with a 
      prescribed speed (<i>inverse differential kinematics</i>). 
      <a href = "https://bit.ly/3RJAz4e">Source</a>.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection><h1>Steps</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Differential IK through inverse jacobian</li>
      The aim is to find the desired joint velocities $v$ from the desired
      spatial (end effector) velocities $V^G$.
      $$v = [J^G(q)]^{\dagger} V^{G}$$
      <p>
        We use a <i>Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse</i> of the jacobian to achieve the
        differential IK controller.
      </p>  
      <li>Velocity limits</li>
      But the pseudoinverse method gets unreliable at the limits of the
      kinematic workspace (i.e. under kinematic singularities). 
      I think the Jacobian becomes singular and the pseudoinverse of it
      generates very large values.
      We turn this into an optimisation problem:
      <eq id="eq1">
        \begin{equation}\displaylines{  
          \min_v \quad & \|\bJ(q)v - V_d\|^2_2\\
          s.t. \quad & |v|\leq v_{max}     
        }\end{equation}
      </eq>
      <p>
        I think the aim is to minimise the difference between the ee 
        velocity that can actually be achieved and the desired target ee velocity. 
        The absolute value is taken element wise, 
        so the last constraint on the joint velocities is really saying 
        "for all $i$, make sure none of the 
        elements of $|v[i]|$ exceed $v_{max}[i]$. Such constraints are also 
        called <i>Bounding Box constraints</i>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>Position and acceleration limits</li>
        in addition to doing joint velocity constraints, we can also put 
        constraints on joint positions and accelerations through 
        first-order Euler finite difference. Given $v_{now}$ and $q_{now}$:

        <eq id="eq2">
          \begin{equation}
            \displaylines{  
            \min_v \quad & \|\bJ(q)v - V_d\|^2_2\\
            s.t. \quad & |v|\leq v_{max} \\
            \quad & q_{min} \leq q_{now} + h v \leq q_{max} \\
            \quad & a_{min} \leq (v-v_{now})/h \leq a_{max}
            }
        \end{equation}
      </eq>
        
        $h==dt$, the timestep.
