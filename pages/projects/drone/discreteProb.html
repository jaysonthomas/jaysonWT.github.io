<section id="1"><h1>Example</h1>
  We are running tests to see if a bot comes to a stop at exactly the right point 
  when it is asked to stop. We run the test a 1000 times. At the end of each test we
  measure its position w.r.t. the target. The results are as shown 
  <a href="https://t.ly/3nOj">here</a>.

  $$
    P(Bot\, stops\, 1mm\, from\, target) = 
    \frac{Frequency\, of\, particular\, event}
    {Total\, number\, of\, events} = \frac{900}{1000} = 0.9
  $$

  Random variable, $X$, represents the event, i.e. the error in the final position.
  <br>
  Example, $x_2 = 2000$, $P(X=x_2) = 0.05$.
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Random variable</h1>
  A <code>random variable</code> has more than one possible values. When
  actually measured, the variable will take one of these values at random, each with a
  certain probability. For example, the side on which a coin lands is a random variable with
  two possible values: heads and tails, each with a probability of 0.5.
  It takes on integer values to represent an event if the event's name 
  is in string format

  <p>
    A <code>deterministic variable</code> is a variable with only one possible fixed 
    value at any given time. For example, a person's age is a deterministic variable.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Expected value</h1>
  It is not the most likely, but the average value that we'd expect to
  get if we were to continue drawing from a distribution over and over again.
  It gives the long-run average value of a repeated probabilistic experiment.
  $$
    E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}x_iP(X=x_i)
  $$
  It's the value of the random variable, times the likelihood of each of 
  those outcomes all summed together. When the probability of each event is
  $\frac{1}{N}$, the expected value is equal to the mean of the distribution.

  <p>
    The expected value of a random variable, where the underlying events are truly 
    non-numeric quantities such as working or not working, may not be useful because
    the values assigned to the random variables don't make much sense.
    But in the example above, where the underlying events (final position of the bot)
    are numeric events, the expected value tells us something about
    what we might expect to see at any given time. 
  </p>
</section>

<section id="4"><h1>Variance</h1>
  When we are drawing from a distribution over and over again, 
  the <code>variance</code> tells us how spread out the numbers or
  samples (the values being drawn) will be from the mean(the expected value need not be
  equal to the mean).
  People sometimes use the variance as a measure of how well we know the mean,
  something like a confidence. It's important to understand it isn't that,
  but it will tell us how much the samples vary.

  $$
    \sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i-\mu)^2P(X=x_i)
  $$

  I had asked <a href="https://t.ly/CUyG">this</a> question on stackexchange.
  Another good <a href="https://t.ly/-5LN">reference</a>. 
  <a href="https://t.ly/jWCR">Code example</a>.

  <p>
    When the probability of every outcome $P(x_i)$ is $\frac{1}{N}$, the variance 
    is just the average of the squared differences from the mean.

    $$
      \sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{(x_i-\mu)^2}{N}
    $$
  </p>
  
  <subsection><h1>Equation deepdive</h1>
    Subtracting the mean makes the mean the zero point. It is a shift
    operation. We can now represent everything w.r.t the mean as simple
    <i>deviations</i> as shown <a href="https://t.ly/dipKw">here</a>.
    Squaring the deviations as opposed to taking the raw or absolute values 
    (i.e. not squaring), helps to amplify the deviations of samples from the 
    mean which is helpful when comparing the variances of 2 different distributions.
  </subsection>  

  <subsection><h1>Standard deviation</h1>
    <code>Standard deviation</code> is the square root of variance.
  </subsection>
</section>

<section id="5"><h1>Z-score</h1>
  It is the number of standard deviations from the mean.
  Steps in calculating:
  <ul>
    <li>
      For each number: subtract the mean, i.e. centre the distribution
      at the mean. This difference will give us each number's deviation
      from the mean.
    </li>
    <li>
      Given a deviation, to find out how many standard deviations that is,
      divide it by a single standard deviation.
    </li>
    $$
      zScore = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
    $$
    It is similar to mapping 100seconds to the equivalent number of minutes.
    Since a minute is 60s, we divide 100 by 60 to get the answer. Here,
    each x-axis division is a standard deviation (denominator). The numerator
    is the deviation from the mean along the x-axis scale.
    Love the illustration <a href="https://t.ly/KsMH">here</a>.
    I like the example <a href="https://t.ly/hEXC">here</a>.
  </ul>

<section id="6"><h1>Normalisation</h1>
  Different types of normalisation and when to use each: 
  <a href="https://t.ly/PN_i">Ref</a>.

  <p>
    The relative frequency of events may not be in the range of 0 to 1. 
    But we can make the relative frequency sum to one by normalizing - dividing the 
    probability of each event by the sum of probabilities of all the events.
    A probability is normalized when the probabilities sum to 1.0.
    Any mathematically correct distribution must be normalized, but un-normalized 
    distributions can also be useful if we just want to compare relative probabilities.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="7"><h1>Probability mass function</h1>
  <code>Mass</code> is the quantity of matter in a physical body. It is also a measure of the 
  body's inertia, the resistance to acceleration when a net force is applied. Example uses:
  a mass of cyclists, the film has mass appeal.
  
  A probability distribution divides the whole <code>probability mass</code> (equal to 1) of a
  random variable and distributes it across its possible outcomes, the 
  variable's sample space. When the outcomes are discrete, the 
  probability distribution function is called a <code>probability mass function</code>.

  <p>
    A <code>probability distribution</code> is a list of events with their 
    associated probabilities. It can be written as a function that maps from the 
    outcomes to their corresponding probabilities. One can look at a distribution and ask, 
    what is the most likely event?
