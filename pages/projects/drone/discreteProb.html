<section id="1"><h1>Variance</h1>
  <code>Variance</code> is the average of the squared differences from the Mean.
  The way to calculate the variance:
  <ul>
    <li>Find the mean</li>
    <li>
      For each number: subtract the mean and square the result 
      (the squared difference)
    </li>
    Subtracting the mean makes the mean the zero point. It is a shift
    operation. We can now represent everything w.r.t the mean as simple
    deviations as shown <a href="https://t.ly/dipKw">here</a>.
    Squaring the differences amplifies the deviation from the mean when
    we calculate the average in the next step. This is useful when we compare
    2 different distributions - we then have just 1 number representing each distribution
    that contains all the information necessary to determine how spread out each
    distribution is from its mean.
    <br><br>

    <li>Find the average of the squared differences</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Standard deviation</h1>
  It is a measure of how spread out numbers are.
  $$\displaylines{
    \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum^{N}_{i=1}(x_i-\mu)^2} \\
    Variance = \sigma^{2}
  }$$
</section>

<section id="3"><h1>Z-score</h1>
  It is the number of standard deviations from the mean.
  Steps in calculating:
  <ul>
    <li>
      For each number: subtract the mean, i.e. centre the distribution
      at the mean. This difference will give us each number's deviation
      from the mean.
    </li>
    <li>
      Given a deviation, to find out how many standard deviations that is,
      divide it by a single standard deviation.
    </li>
    $$
      zScore = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
    $$
    It is similar to mapping 100seconds to the equivalent number of minutes.
    Since a minute is 60s, we divide 100 by 60 to get the answer. Here,
    each x-axis division is a standard deviation (denominator). The numerator
    is the deviation from the mean along the x-axis scale.
    Love the illustration <a href="https://t.ly/KsMH">here</a>.
    I like the example <a href="https://t.ly/hEXC">here</a>.

        List of events with their associated probabilities.

        corresponding probabilities

    </tr>

      <td>The event is certain to happen</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Probability mass function</td>
      <td>
        When the outcomes are discrete, the PD function is called a 
        probability mass function

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Normalization</td>
      <td>
        The relative frequency of events may not be in the range of 0 to 1. 
        But we can make the relative frequency sum to one by normalizing - dividing the 
        probability of each event by the sum of probabilities of all the events.
        A probability is normalized when the probabilities sum to 1.0.
        <br> 
        Any mathematically correct distribution must be normalized, but un-normalized 
        distributions can also be useful if we just want to compare relative probabilities.

<section id="6"><h1>Example</h1>
  Let's think about whether a vehicle is working or not working:
  <figure>
    <img style="height:200px; width:auto"
    src="../../../figures/drone/7_probExample.png"/>
    <figcaption>
      Example of probability
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  $$
    P(working) = 
    \frac{Frequency\, of\, working}
    {Total\, number\, of\, events} = \frac{9}{9+1} = 0.9
  $$
  Because this is a discrete sample space, we can write it in the form of a table.
</section>

<section id="7"><h1>Expected value</h1>
  It is often referred to as the expectation, the mean, the average, or the first moment.
  The <code>expected value</code> is, on any given draw from a distribution,
  is the value we would expect to get?
  Not the most likely, but the average value that we'd expect to
  get if we were to continue drawing from this distribution over and over again.
  It gives the long-run average value of a repeated probabilistic experiment.
  $$
    E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{N}x_iP(X=x_i)
  $$
  It's the integer value of the random variable, times the likelihood of each of 
  those outcomes all summed together. 

  <p>
    The expected value of a random variable, where the underlying events are truly 
    non-numeric quantities such as working or not working, may not be useful. 
    In the above example, if we compute the expected value of that variable X, it's going 
    to be equal to 0.15. What that means is really unclear. 
  </p>

  But imagine our sample space is actually a numeric quantity, such as the number of 
  GPS satellites that a flying car can see or the birds that we can spot at any given
  time. <a href="https://t.ly/CUyG">Ref</a>. The expected value tells us something about
  what we might expect to see at any given time.
</section>

<section id="8"><h1>Variance</h1>
  When we are drawing from a distribution over and over again, 
  the <code>variance</code> tells us how spread out the samples (the values being drawn)
  will be around the mean. It measures how spread out the numbers are 
  from the mean (the expected value).
  People sometimes use the variance as a measure of how well we know the mean,
  something like a confidence. It's important to understand it isn't that,
  but it will tell us how much the samples vary.

  $$
    \sigma^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i-\mu)^2P(X=x_i)
  $$

  I had asked <a href="https://t.ly/CUyG">this</a> question on stackexchange.
</section>

<section id="10"><h1>Musings</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In the standard deviation formula, if $\frac{1}{N}$ was outside
      the square root, that would have made sense, because it would be 
      the average of the squared deviations.
    </li>
    <br><br>
    
    <li>Why are there multiple formulae for variance</li>
    <a href="https://t.ly/-5LN">Ref1</a>,
    <a href="https://t.ly/fKH7">Ref2</a>.
    <br><br>
    
    <li>Explain what a random variable is</li>
    <li>
      I want to see a real life usage of variance to understand
      how spread out the samples are from the mean.
    </li>
