<section id="1"><h1>Intro</h1>
  An example of a continuous samples space is the real value position of a satellite?
  Random variables become extremely powerful in this case.
  Using real numbers to index the members of a continuous set is fairly intuitive.

  <p>
    When dealing with a continuous sample space,
    we can no longer say anything about the probability
    that our vehicle is at some specific location,
    because for a continuous sample space,
    the probability of any particular value will always be zero.
    We can only give the probability that our vehicle is in some region.

    $$
      F_x(u) = p(x \leq u)
    $$

    The function describes the probability that a random variable $x$ is less than or equal
    to $u$. 
    
    <p>
      A <code>limit</code> is a value toward which an expression converges as one or more 
      variables approach certain values.
    </p>

    <p>
      $F$ will be monotonically increasing.
      The limit of $F$ as $u$ goes to negative infinity is zero,
      and the limit as $u$ goes to positive infinity is one.
      It's important to understand that the index to the function is $u$,
      but it is sub-scripted by $x$ to indicate which random variable we're characterizing by
      the probability that the value of that random variable is less than $u$ or not.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  
  <subsection><h1>Probability density function</h1>
    $$
      f_x(u) = \frac{d}{du}F_x(u)
    $$
    It's the derivative of a CDF w.r.t. its index.

        Uniform PDF for the position $x$ of a vehicle
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      Consider this uniform PDF for the position $x$ of a vehicle.
      It has the value 0.5 between $x$ equals zero and two, and zero everywhere else.
      The probability that the vehicle is in the region between 0 and 2 is found
      by calculating the area under the curve which would be $2*0.5$.
      In fact, the probability that a random variable will take a value between x1 and x2,
      is given by the integral of the probability density function from x1 to x2.

      $$
        p(x_1 < x < x_2) = \int^{x_2}_{x_1}f_x(x)dx
      $$
    </p>
  </subsection>

  This lowercase f of x isn't the probability,
  and it can easily be greater than one.
  But we do often write this density function as p of x.
  This changes our notion of what it means to be a proper distribution.
  To be a proper density,
  lowercase f sub x of u has to be greater than or equal to zero,
  and the integral under the distribution has to be equal to one.
  Normalization implies finding a constant multiplier in
  front of this density function to make it integrate to one.
