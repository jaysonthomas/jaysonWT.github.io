<section id="1"><h1>Overview</h1>
  What do we want our core controller (the one running at the highest bandwidth
  i.e. the tightest control loop at the lowest level) to be.
  There are times where choosing to act like a force controller down at the lower level 
  (to close a loop on a force sensor) can be a better choice than trying to act
  like a position controller. Example, writing on a board.

  <p>
    Another good example of something that's native in forces: 
    we want to push a book to the edge of a table. If you can rely on the assumption 
    that the friction forces between the hand and the book is larger than the forces 
    between the book and the table, then you need to put yourself in a regime where you're 
    not pushing too hard such that the book sticks on the table but you're also not pushing 
    too softly. We want to be in this nice regime where moving the hand moves the book on the 
    table. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We're first going to assume the EE is a point and that we can perfectly control it - 
    the point finger approximation.
    We'll take away the abstraction and add the robot back in later.
    This abstraction means that we only come into contact with an object at one contact point.
    We don't have to worry about the complicated geometry of a finger.
    The finger is drawn as a sphere, but we'll think of it as a point. 
  </p>
</section>

<section id="2"><h1>Task setup</h1>
  We need to flip up a box with a point-finger approximation.
  This is a task that can be described naturally in the language of forces. 
  We'll model the forces between the box and the ground.  
  We specify contact points (yellow) 
  to make sure that when the simulation is run, the solver doesn't have to 
  arbitrarily pick points (where it computes the forces) on the box. 
  Those forces are going to have friction cones at the points which are a response to 
  gravity pulling down on the object when it is at rest.

  Once the box is tilted up, we're going to have contact forces on the back corner.
